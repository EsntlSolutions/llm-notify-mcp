## üí° Tips

1. **Download Enhanced Voices**: The built-in voices are basic. Enhanced voices sound much more natural.
2. **Test Before Configuring**: Use `say -v VoiceName "test"` to hear each voice
3. **Consider Context**: Some voices work better for alerts vs. longer messages
4. **Rate Adjustment**: Slower rates often sound more natural:
   - **150-170**: Very natural, easy to understand
   - **180**: Good balance (current default)
   - **200+**: Fast, good for urgent alerts
   - **100-140**: Slow, good for detailed information

### Test Different Speech Rates
```bash
say -r 150 "Testing slow speech rate"
say -r 180 "Testing normal speech rate" 
say -r 220 "Testing fast speech rate"
```
